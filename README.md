If your decision relies on the outcome of the quantum experiment, there will be many versions of you that make different decisions.

## Rules of the game

  1. Enter your commitments, two different things that you are willing to do.
  2. Hit the Î¨ button.
  3. Do according whatever appears on your screen.


DISCLAIMER: use at your own risk, don't blame the application (or me) for your "bad" decisions.


## Original Application

Unfortunately the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/universe-splitter/id329233299">Official Application</a> is not available on android, so I decided to make a similar one.


## Inspiration

 - Sean Carroll's new book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Something-Deeply-Hidden-Emergence-Spacetime/dp/1524743011">Something deeply hidden</a>
