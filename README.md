According to the Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics, every possible outcome of a quantum experiment happens.
If your decision relies on the outcome of the quantum experiment, there will be many versions of you that make different decisions.

[ETHZürich](http://qrng.ethz.ch/) Quantum RNG for OpenQu is used to generate a random number, hence branching the universe.


## Rules of the game
